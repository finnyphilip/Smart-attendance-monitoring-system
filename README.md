# Smart-attendance-monitoring-system
The idea was awarded [Xilinx KV260 Vision AI starter kit](https://www.xilinx.com/products/som/kria/kv260-vision-starter-kit.html) for [_Adaptive Computing Challenge 2021_](https://www.hackster.io/contests/xilinxadaptivecomputing2021#challengeNav) organised by Xilinx and Hackster.io
## Problem Statement
Through this project, the primary aim is to create a smart system for contactless attendance monitoring at schools and offices. During the covid pandemic, the world tried to minimize physical contact as much as possible. Most of the offices around the world use fingerprint systems for checking in to the office, while educational institutes do manual roll calling. 

## The Idea
The smart attendance monitor will identify faces and thus monitor the attendance. Thereby eliminating the need for manual attendance marking. For schools, the system can be further made to alert parents that their children had reached the classroom. The system will be very convenient as it could be wall mounted at the entrance of classrooms or office rooms. Students and staff can either come in front of the camera to detect their faces but this system can be also made to identify faces from a crowd. Thus could be even used at industries.
